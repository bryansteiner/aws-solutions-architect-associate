# Exam Study Path

The following is my study path for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020 exam (SAA-C02):

- Learning Phase:
    - [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) - I completed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020 course and associated labs. They were very useful primer for what to expect on the exam but from what I gathered, taking the course alone isn't enough to pass the exam.
    - [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) - As I went through this course, I also made sure to bookmark relevant documentation from the AWS official site. For example when I learning CloudFront, I would skim through the [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) as well as the [FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/). I personally found it useful to store my bookmarks in a hierarchy that made sense

    - [AWS Well Architected Framework](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf) - I read through this whitepaper which covered the Five Pillars & Design Principles of a Well Architecured Framework in AWS. This paper was useful when preparing for the scenario-based questions on the actual exam.
- Exam Preparation:
    - [AWS Cheat Sheets](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/) - Within a couple of weeks of finishing the course, I rewatched the A Cloud Guru summary videos and retook the quizzes. Then I went through cheat sheets from [Tutorials Dojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/)
        - I found these cheatsheets to be a very concise version of the documentation I referred to earlier and this helped to speed up my prep time.
    - [Exam Readiness](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=20685) - In the week before the exam, I took this official AWS course to test my preparedness. It greatly helped to understand the logistics of the exam and understanding the structure + question types.

    - Practice Exams:

        - [Jon Bonso's Practice Exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/) - I went ahead and purchased these practice exams even though there were mixed feelings about them online. I found them useful to cover knowledge gaps.
        - [Linux Academy Practice Exam](https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-2019-associate-level/) - I used the 7 day free-trial and attempted the final practice exam.
        - [Whiz Labs Practice Exam](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate/) - I only attempted the Free Test with 20 questions.
